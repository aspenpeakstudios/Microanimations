        story: 'I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and a focus on Software Engineering.  I felt the need to prove myself at that age so I spent my time taking the hardest software, math and science classes I could, the ones geared for engineers.  I learned how to work in groups and that sometimes you need to step up and lead the group in order to get things done.  At one point I also had 3 W2 jobs and a paying gig job as the drummer in a cover band.  I didnâ€™t want to be in debt.  If I could go back in time and redo the whole experience, I would make myself slow down and relax a bit.  On the upside I came away with my future wife, 8 close friends I still hang out with to this day, several job offers, and learned to snowboard.'
